<span class="title">Setting up your website template:</span><br>
<b>WARNING:</b> Because of the large sizes of sound files, you may want to keep your bandwith usage in mind on your account so you don't go over any limits if your site gets very popular. Also, all sound files used on AllWebCo hosting MUST be legal for you to use and not infringe on any copyrights.<br>

<br>


<span class="title">Step 1:<BR></span>
<b>EDIT FLASH ANIMATION:</b> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_flash_details.htm">Click for more details</a><br>
Open the "flash.txt" file with Notepad and change the text following "logo=" to match your name or company name. Be sure not to delete the "logo=". You can also change the "&cornerletter=" to other letters and the "&slogan=" to anything that you would like. Be sure not to delete the "&slogan=" or any of the code text for each line. This will change the Flash logo on all pages. If you wish to use a graphic logo, there are instructions later in this document.

<br><br>


<span class="title">Step 2:<BR></span>
<b>EDIT COPYRIGHT:</b> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_js_files.htm">Click for more details</a><br>
Open the "copyright.js" file in Notepad or any text editor, and change the "Your Company" and "info@yourdomain.com" lines to match your information. This will change the lower page info on all pages. Edit all ".js" files with a text editor.

<br><br>


<span class="title">Step 3:<BR></span>
<b>EDIT CONTACT INFO:</b> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_js_files.htm">Click for more details</a><br>
Open the "phone.js" file in Notepad or any text editor and change the company name, address, phone number and e-mail address. This will change contact info on the contact page.

<br><br>



<span class="title">Step 4:<BR></span>
<b>EDIT THE CONTACT FORM:</b> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_contact_form.htm">Click for more details</a><br>
If you are setup with an AllWebCo hosting account. Go to your control panel at "http://your-domain.com/cgi-bin/plusmail" and install the free script "Formail" then edit the contact page and replace "your-domain.com" with your domain.<BR><BR>

If you are not set up with AllWebCo hosting or do not have "Formail" installed. You can either setup the contact form to use another contact script, install "Formail" on your server or you can remove the contact form from the pages between the comment tags.<BR><BR>


If you wish to change the sizes of the form elements you can open the "corporatestyle.css" in Notepad or any text editor and change the ".shadeform" ".textarea" and ".dropdown" width numbers.

<br><br>


<span class="title">Step 5:<BR></span>
<b>REPLACE THE GALLERY PICTURES:</b> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_gallery_replacment.htm">Click for more details</a> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_thumbnail_replacment_details.htm">Thumbnail Help</a><br>

The best way to setup the pictures in the gallery is not to actually edit the HTML pages and change the pictures on each individual page. The fastest way is to simply replace the pictures in the "gallery" directory with your own by overwriting the files that are in there now and using the same generic names.<br><br>

In the "gallery" directory, replace the 27 "Fgallery" pictures with full size photos. Replace the 27 "gallery" pictures with your thumbnails. The thumbnails are now 100 x 70 pixels but you can make them any size that you prefer.

<br><br>

There is a section later in this document that explains how to change the pictures on each page.

<br><br>

<b>POP UP WINDOW OPTIONS:</b> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_pop-ups_variables.htm">Click for more details</a><br>
This template includes 27 options for the pop-up windows. To change these options, open your "pop-closeup.js" in Notepad and put a "yes" or "no" (all lowercase) for the options you want to change. You will find all the options near the top of the "pop-closeup.js". You can also change the height and width variables as well as turn on and off the scrollbars. See the notes in the "pop-closeup.js" for details.


<br><br>


<span class="title">Step 6:<BR></span>
<b>EDIT THE SOUND:</b><br>
The index is using two external .mp3 files for the "vault" sound and the "crash" riff. They are in the main directory and called "sound.mp3" and "sound2.mp3". Simply replace them with your own .mp3 files. Try to keep the files small so the site downloads faster.

<br><br>

<b>SOUND GALLERY:</b><br>
The "sound gallery" can use any type of sounds, .mp3, .mid, .wav or any other browser compatible files. You can replace all the .mp3 files in the "sound" directory with your own. Each is named for the page and placement on the page. Example: "song1-1.mp3" is in gallery 1, spot 1. "song2-12.mp3" is in gallery 2, spot 12. It's quicker to simply replace these mp3 files rather than edit the HTML pages, although you can do this either way. Editing the HTML is best done in Notepad before you start editing the pages using other HTML software.

<br><br>


<span class="title">Step 7:<BR></span>
<b>EDIT PAGES:</b> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_HTML_software.htm">Software choices</a> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_edit_in_notepad.htm">Notepad Editing</a><br>
Change the text on all pages to match your information. You can use Frontpage, Dreamweaver, GoLive, any wysiwyg HTML editor or a text editor like Notepad. Take care not to delete any of the HTML tags that surround the text.

<br><br>


<span class="title">Step 8:<BR></span>
<b>EDIT TITLES, DESCRIPTIONS AND KEYWORDS:</b> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_Frontpage_titles.htm">Click for more details</a><br>
Open each of the pages in Notepad and change the titles (at the very top of the page) and also the description and the keywords to match your product or service. (in Frontpage use "file" "properties" and hit the "custom" tab and "general" tab) You can edit one page and copy and paste to the other pages. Be careful to only change what's inside the "" so you don't disturb the html code. Keywords are very important so your site will get a good listing at msn and other search engines.

<br><br>




<span class="title">Step 9:<BR></span>
<b>UPLOAD:</b> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_FTP.htm">Click for more details</a><br>
Upload the pages on to your hosting company's server using ftp software like <a href="http://cuteftp.com/">CuteFTP</a> or <a href="http://www.tucows.com/preview/195147.html">Coffee Cup</a> (free) or your control panel. Be sure to make a directory called picts on your server and put the pictures into that directory.







<br><br><br><br>


<span class="title">Options:<BR></span>

<BR>



<b>USING A GRAPHIC LOGO:</b><br>
You can replace the Flash logo with a graphic logo. To do this, delete or rename the "header.js", then rename the "graphic_header.js" to "header.js". In the picts directory you will find a graphic called "logo.gif". Edit this graphic with your logo. It's best to keep the graphic the same size that it is now unless you edit the image size numbers in the new "header.js".

<br><br>

<b>USING NO SOUND ON THE HOMEPAGE:</b><br>
If you would like no sound n the homepage of your website, open the index.html in Notepad and replace "header.js" (about 20 lines down) with "header-nosound.js".

<br><br>

<b>EDITING THE MP3 PLAYER IN THE POP-UP:</b> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_pop-ups_variables.htm">Click for more details</a><br>
You can control which players are showing, if the download icons show and more in the mp3 player popup. Open the "pop-closeup.js" in a text editor and check the notes inside for more details.

<br><br>

<b>SETTING UP THE SLIDESHOW PICTURES:</b><br>
The slideshow is currently setup to display all 27 pictures in the gallery directory. If you would like to add or remove pictures from the slideshow, open the slideshow.htm in Notepad and look for the "EDIT THIS AREA" note. Copy and paste to add new pictures to the list, or delete lines to remove pictures. You can also set the AutoPlay speed. Look for "var rotate_delay = 3000".

<br><br>

<b>FONTS:</b> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_font_colors.htm">Click for more details</a><br>
You can change your font colors and sizes by editing the "corporatestyle.css" with a text editor. <a href="http://allwebco.com/colors.html">You can find other font colors by clicking here</a>. You can also change the font sizes in the "corporatestyle.css" file. Change the "TABLE" px size to change the copy on all pages. Change the "title" px size to change all the title sizes.

<br><br>

<b>CHANGING / ADDING BUTTONS:</b> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_menu_editing.htm">Click for more details</a><br>
You can change the names on the buttons like "the scene" or "service" to other page names by editing the "menu.js" in Notepad. Only change the one instance of the name and not the name with the ".htm" after it. Whatever you change in the menu.js will change every page on the website. Keep the names short so they don't go outside the menu. You can even add more pages by copying one button in the menu.js and pasting it right below the next. Be sure to back up your file before you edit it.

<br><br>


<b>PICTURES:</b> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_pictures_change.htm">Click for more details</a><br>
You can replace the pictures with your own. The pictures are now 750 x 125 pixels but you can use any size picture you want and the pages will size them to fit automatically. Each page has it's own picture which is named according to the page it's on. There are also 3 album.jpg pictures to replace with your own cover art. You will find all pictures in the "picts" directory.


<br><br>

<b>ADDING PAGES:</b> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_add_remove_pages.htm">Click for more details</a><br>
You can add pages to your website by copying and pasting any one of the pages and renaming it to whatever you need. You can then add links from the other pages or even add the page to the menu by opening the menu.js and copying and pasting one of the buttons below another. There are notes in the "menu.js" to help you add a button.


<br><br>


<span class="title"><b>PAYPAL SETUP</span><br>
SETTING UP ALBUMS FOR PURCHASING:</b> | <a href="http://www.allwebco-templates.com/support/S_paypal.htm">Click for more details</a><br>
You can have your albums (cds) link to paypal so visitors can purchase them. Forms have been created on the pages so it's easier to setup, however they will need to be edited. This will not create a shopping cart, however visitors will be able to make a single purchase. You can get shopping cart HTML code from Paypal. Login to your Paypal account and see their instructions in the developers area.<br>

<blockquote>

<b>STEP 1:</b> Set up a paypal account and get the HTML code you need to setup purchases from your site. You will need the info between the "&lt;form&gt;" and "&lt;/form&gt;" tags from paypal.<br>

<br>


<b>STEP 2:</b> Edit all the sound?.htm pages and replace the "form" info with your new Paypal "form" info. There is a <a href="thanks-payment.htm">thank you page</a> included. You may want to use the submit button that is on the page now. Simply paste the Paypal info in and replace their "submit" button with the one on the page now.<br>
