<P>Middle school and high school students are expected to participate in the district solo and ensemble contest sponsored by the OMEA in the spring.  I also direct students to opportunities for state and regional honor ensembles such as: Portland Youth Philharmonic, Salem Youth Symphony, Allstate Band, All City Band, All Northwest Band.  I will assist students in their preparation for any auditions, as well as for Competitions, College Admissions and Scholarship auditions.  I am proud of the high level of playing and commitment my students display.  Each year the studio produces District and State Solo Champions, Concerto Competition Finalists, All-Northwest, All-State, and All-City band participants and many thousands of dollars in flute performance scholarships. I look forward to a rewarding relationship with all of my flute students and their families.  </P>
