About Us<BR>
</span>
<b>RoseWynde flute and harp duo</b> has been a working group since 1998.  We arrange our own music with a blend of 
our classical training with our love of Celtic and traditional folk tunes.  Building a body of literature for this
 instrumentation through writing and arranging has been a primary focus of the group. Besides recording we have published 
four collections from our CD's through ALRY Music in Charlotte, North Carolina.   Finding traditional Irish, Scottish,
and American literature to arrange, record, and publish has been professionally and artistically satisfying.
<br><b>Sandy Duffy Norman</b>, originally from Atlanta, Georgia, lives in Salem, Oregon where she is a teacher and a flutist.
 Sandy has maintained her private studio, Sunridge Flute Studios, in Salem, Oregon since 1984. She also taught
 middle school band for 15 years. Sandy received her B.S.Mus and B.M.E. from LSU, continued with graduate studies 
at Western Oregon University, is a member of B.M.I.,belongs to the MENC/OMEA, NFA and serves on the board of the Greater 
Portland Flute Society. Sandy has three children and resides on Sunridge Drive with her husband, Jim.

<br><b>Kathryn Cater</b>, a graduate of Lewis and Clark in Portland, Oregon, is a performer, arranger, and composer. 
She has been composing since the age of seven, and most recently has published four books of harp songs for students.  
Kathryn has compositions and arrangements available through ALRY Publications and Afghan Press Publications. 
Kathryn teaches and composes in her studio on her century farm near Portland with her husband, Scott and their
 two daughters, Elizabeth and Diana.
